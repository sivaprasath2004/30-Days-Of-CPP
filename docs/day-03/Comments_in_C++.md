# Comments in C++

Comments in C++ are essential for documenting code and making it more understandable. There are two types of comments in C++:

## Single-line comments

These comments begin with `//` and continue until the end of the line. They are often used for short, inline explanations.

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 5; // This is also a single-line comment
```
# Multi-line Comments in C++

Multi-line comments in C++ begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines and are often used for longer explanations or for temporarily disabling blocks of code.

```cpp
/* This is a multi-line comment
   It can span multiple lines */
int y = 10;

/*
This is another example of a multi-line comment
that spans multiple lines
*/
```

Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program. They are purely for the benefit of developers to understand the code better. It's good practice to include comments to explain complex logic, algorithmic steps, or to provide context for future maintainers of the code.
